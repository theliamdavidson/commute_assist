fun side project to streamline my strava use. 

marks the most recent activity as a commute, changes bike, and mutes it from my home page. 

does not have the ability to walk through the entire authorization process (yet) so requires a lot of hand holding while setting up for the time being. 

simply create a config.py file with your various strava tokens and run the main file. i have an automation that runs the main file run when my phone connects to work / home wifi
